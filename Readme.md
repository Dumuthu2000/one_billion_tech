Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** and **npm**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MySQL**: [Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)


## ðŸ”©Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dumuthu2000/one_billion_tech.git

2. **Navigate to the server directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install

3. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install

## ðŸ“¦Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in the application. Please ensure to create two .env files for server and client
### Server Configuration
- `PORT`:  Port on which the server will run.
  
#### Database Configuration
- `DB_HOST`:  Host of the database.
- `DB_USER`:  Database username.
- `DB_PASSWORD`:  Database password.
- `DB_NAME`:   Name of the database.

#### Security Configuration
- `HASHING_PASSWORD_SALTROUNDS`:  The number of salt rounds for password hashing.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for signing JWT tokens.

#### Email Configuration
- `EMAIL_HOST`:  SMTP host for email services.
- `EMAIL_PORT`:  Port for email SMTP.
- `EMAIL_USER`:  Email service username.
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`:  Email service password.

### Client Configuration
#### Backend URL Configuration
- `VITE_BASE_URL`: URL for server.

## ðŸ”¥Environment Setup

To configure your environment variables, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Sample Environment Files**:
   - For **Server**: Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env` in the server directory.
   - For **Client**: Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env` in the client directory.

2. **Set the Environment Variables**:
   Open the `.env` files in both the server and client directories and replace the placeholders with your actual values for the configuration settings (e.g., database credentials, email configuration, JWT secret key).

### MailTrap Setup for Password Reset Emails

The Forgot Password feature uses MailTrap to send password reset emails. To enable this feature, you need to replace the `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` values in your `.env` file with your own MailTrap credentials:

#### Steps to Set Up MailTrap:

1. **Create a MailTrap Account**:
   - Sign up at [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/) if you donâ€™t have an account.

2. **Set Up an Inbox**:
   - After logging in, create a new inbox or select an existing one.

3. **Copy Your SMTP Credentials**:
   - Go to your inbox's SMTP Settings and copy the username and password values.

4. **Update `.env` File**:
   - Replace `<your-mailtrap-username>` and `<your-mailtrap-password>` in your server `.env` file with your MailTrap credentials:

   ```env
   EMAIL_USER= <your-mailtrap-username>
   EMAIL_PASSWORD= <your-mailtrap-password>

## Database Setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install MySQL and create a database named `todo-list-one-billion-tech `.

### Creating MySQL Database in CLI

1. Open the **MySQL Command Line Client**:
   - You can find it in the Start menu under `MySQL` or simply search for "MySQL Command Line Client".
   - When prompted, enter the MySQL root password that you set during installation.

2. In the MySQL CLI, run the following command to create a new database named `myDb`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE todo-list-one-billion-tech;

### Creating MySQL Database on XAMPP

### Prerequisites
- Ensure XAMPP is installed and running on your Windows machine.
- Start the Apache and MySQL modules in the XAMPP Control Panel.

### Steps to Create Database `todo-list-one-billion-tech` in XAMPP

1. **Open phpMyAdmin**:
   - Launch XAMPP and make sure the Apache and MySQL services are running.
   - Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

2. **Create the Database**:
   - In phpMyAdmin, look at the top menu and click on **Databases**.
   - In the **Create database** field, enter `todo-list-one-billion-tech` as the database name.
   - Leave the collation as default (usually `utf8mb4_general_ci`), or select one based on your requirements.
   - Click **Create** to create the database.

3. **Verify the Database**:
   - After creating it, you should see `todo-list-one-billion-tech` listed on the left sidebar under the list of databases..
